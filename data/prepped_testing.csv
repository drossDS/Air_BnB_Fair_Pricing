We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!",100.0,98.0,8,8,42.38038,-71.02937,2,1.0,1.0,"[""Wifi"", ""Stove"", ""Keypad"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""First aid kit"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Toaster"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Iron"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shower gel"", ""Body soap"", ""Freezer"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Conditioner"", ""Shampoo"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Oven"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dining table"", ""Microwave"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Coffee"", ""Essentials"", ""Hot water"", ""Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Self check-in"", ""Heating"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",96.0,1,14,24,54,79,169,477,78,3,8,0,8,0,7.51,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.006238906385739296,9.59014573330377,4.605170185988092,4.584967478670572,2.0794415416798357,2.0794415416798357,0.6931471805599453,0.0,0.0,4.564348191467836,0.0,2.6390573296152584,3.1780538303479458,3.9889840465642745,4.3694478524670215,5.1298987149230735,6.1675164908883415,4.356708826689592,1.0986122886681098,2.0794415416798357,0.0,2.0794415416798357,0.0,2.0162354657760435,-5.0,0.0,-4.0,-5.076950370656026

We're a young (very young) and fun loving couple currently living, working and enjoying this great city of Boston.  

We are both originally from the lone star state, but met and got married in Shanghai just before repatriating back to the U.S. It’s a very long story!  

We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle, and travel.  We are always thinking, planning and dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  And anywhere we travel, we usually seek out the latest culinary experience or seeking that perfectly balanced cocktail.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is truly an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and feel at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always! 

We are committed on making your stay with us an unforgettable EXPERIENCE!
 
We have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing in 2000 to continue with my professional career. 

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  

We really look forward to hosting you soon!

In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!",100.0,98.0,8,8,42.37642,-71.03784,2,1.0,1.0,"[""Wifi"", ""Stove"", ""Keypad"", ""Kitchen"", ""Free street parking"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Toaster"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Iron"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shower gel"", ""Body soap"", ""Freezer"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Conditioner"", ""Shampoo"", ""Bed linens"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Oven"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dining table"", ""Microwave"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Coffee"", ""Essentials"", ""Hot water"", ""Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Self check-in"", ""Heating"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",107.0,1,14,27,57,87,177,658,94,5,8,0,8,0,9.2,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.007800617506971855,9.59014573330377,4.605170185988092,4.584967478670572,2.0794415416798357,2.0794415416798357,0.6931471805599453,0.0,0.0,4.672828834461906,0.0,2.6390573296152584,3.295836866004329,4.04305126783455,4.465908118654584,5.176149732573829,6.489204931325317,4.543294782270004,1.6094379124341003,2.0794415416798357,0.0,2.0794415416798357,0.0,2.2192034840549946,-5.0,0.0,-4.0,-4.853552380859683

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.
